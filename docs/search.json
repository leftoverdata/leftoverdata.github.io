This program was implemented in the early Bush administration and was discontinued in 2013 during beginning of the second Obama administration.\nThis data is interesting largely because of the time that it covers. This ten year timespan overlaps the leadup to and recovery from the Great Recession. It also coincides with some states adopting “Right to Work” laws."
